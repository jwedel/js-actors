# js-actors

A JavaScript Actor-based Component Framework. WIP!

# Overview

This is just a little exploratory idea. I was getting annoyed by the complexity and sheer number of rxjs operators. I was working with Actor based systems, most specifically Erlang and I liked the power and simplicity of that.
So I thought I might give it a try with JS.

I will try to explore the following aspects:
- Components
- Component Trees
- Data binding (one way, two way)
- HTTP requests

As a first attempt, I will try to build the infamous TODO list.

# Build

There is nothing to build. It's just a static sources.

Open the `index.html` in a browser.
